# Simple Games

Here are some simple games that I have made. Most are recreations of games such as breakout and pong. These games are written in python 3, using the pygame library.

## Getting Started

To play these games, you will need python 3 and the pygame library. The newest stable version of python 3 can be downloaded from the python website, or installed using your package manager for linux distributions. Pygame can be installed using your package manager on linux distributions, or using pip on Windows/Mac OS.
